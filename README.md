# Machine-Learning--Insurance-Charge
Regression for insurance prices 


📊 Dataset Overview
The dataset comprises 1,338 records with the following features:

age: Age of the primary beneficiary

sex: Gender of the beneficiary (male/female)

bmi: Body Mass Index

children: Number of dependents covered by insurance

smoker: Smoking status (yes/no)

region: Residential area in the U.S. (northeast, southeast, southwest, northwest)

charges: Individual medical costs billed by health insurance (target variable)​




🔍 Project Highlights

Data Exploration: Analyzed the distribution and relationships of features using visualizations.

Simple Linear Regression: Predicted charges based solely on age to understand its direct impact.

Multiple Linear Regression: Incorporated multiple features to enhance prediction accuracy.

Categorical Encoding: Transformed categorical variables using one-hot encoding for model compatibility.

Model Evaluation: Assessed model performance using metrics like R² and Mean Squared Error (MSE).

Feature Importance: Interpreted regression coefficients to determine the influence of each feature on insurance charges.​




🧪 Technologies Used


Python

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib & Seaborn

Scikit-learn

Google Colab​


📈 Key Insights


Smoking status emerged as the most significant predictor of higher insurance charges.

BMI and age also showed a positive correlation with increased costs.

The multiple linear regression model provided a better fit compared to the simple linear regression model.​
